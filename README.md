LOCATED ON PRIME BRANCH

This is a copy (original repo is react-three-avatar) of my 

portfolio site for works in ThreeJs in React, for deployment on Heroku.

It will most likely become the main repo after June 23rd, as I have 

successfully deployed it to Heroku and will continue to update the live site, link:
